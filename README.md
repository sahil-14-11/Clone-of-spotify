This project is a static clone of the Spotify web player's user interface, created using HTML and CSS.

It replicates the core layout and visual elements of the Spotify platform, including the sidebar with navigation for "Home" and "Search," a "Your Library" section, and a main content area that displays playlists and charts like "Recently Played," "Trending Now near you," and "Featured Charts." It also features a music player at the bottom with standard controls and a progress bar.

This project demonstrates foundational web development skills in structuring a webpage with HTML and styling it with CSS to mimic a popular, modern web application. It is a non-functional visual replica intended for portfolio or practice purposes.
